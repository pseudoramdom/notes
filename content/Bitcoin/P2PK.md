title: P2PK
---

One of the old ways coins were locked - Pay-to-Public-Key 
Only the holder of the private key corresponding to the public key X may spend this coin.

> [!NOTE]
> A P2PK **does not** have an official [address](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/keys/address/). However, you'll sometimes find blockchain explorers displaying addresses for P2PK locking scripts, even though they technically do not have one.

> Early versions of Bitcoin also supported a Pay to IP address feature where your wallet would contact the wallet at a given IP address and request a scriptPubKey to send to. The response would be a P2PK scriptPubKey and thus you would create P2PK outputs.
