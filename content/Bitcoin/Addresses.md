title: Addresses
---
Bitcoin addresses are not part of the blockchain itself. Instead, they are conventions used by wallet software to specify where coins should be sent. An address typically represents a type of _locking script_ to be places on some bitcoins -
- [[P2PK]] – Pay to Public Key
- [[P2PKH]] – Pay to Public Key Hash
- P2SH – Pay to Script Hash
- P2WPKH – Pay to Witness Public Key Hash
- P2WSH – Pay to Witness Script Hash

Each address format corresponds to a specific script that locks the bitcoins, determining how they can be later spent.
